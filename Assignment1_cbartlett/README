Design
------
The purpose of this project is to implement a thread queue with three serialized
threads (including one additional idle thread) and a shared variable. The
application created for this project takes no inputs, but does output serial
debug information. In addition, LEDs are toggled to indicate the state of the
running application. Threads are executed forever using a round-robin schedule.
The first two threads manipulate the globally shared variable and the third
thread monitors the shared variable for errors. If an error occurs, a message is
output through the serial-port and the LEDs flash an error pattern.
